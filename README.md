# Fractal-Apollonian-Gasket
  Plots an Apollonian gasket in which each circle contains its own Apollonian Gasketâ€”any position and zoom value is accepted. Plots are displayed in a new window. A picture of the entire gasket (corresponding to an x and y of 0 and a zoom of 1) has been included under the name FractalGasket.png.

  The jar file should be run in command line because it uses command line input.
